# Interactive Story in Javascript

Here we are, it's the end of the academic year and our teacher [Ariel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arieldorol) gave us a long term project to conclude this one! üòè

**Instructions:** 
- Create an interactive story. The goal is not to create a game, but to tell a story.
- Add interactivity: one music, some animations and at least 3 timelines (ends or paths).
- Load the story data with at least one AJAX request.
- Any library or JS framework is allowed.

## The Plot : Mami Wata Story

**Based on the legend of Mami Watta, aquatic goddess of the Arican Vodun Cult.**<br>
Mami Wata is a water deity venerated in West, Central, and Southern Africa, and in the African diaspora in the Americas. We tried to narrate this legend around **four paths**, supposed to represent the good and bad influence Mami Watta can have on her men.

## The Paths

**3** questions with **6** possible answers will lead you through the story : 
- Where is Koffi going ?<br> 
-- **Market** or **Laguna**
- Did Koffi keep the secret ?<br> 
-- **Yes** or **No**
- Did Koffi keep the secret ?<br> 
-- **Agree** or **Disagree**
